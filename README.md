## **Waze project**
Waze’s free navigation app makes it easier for drivers around the world to get to where they want to go. 
 
This project is designed to help prevent user churn on the Waze app and focuses on monthly user churn
Churn quantifies the number of users who have uninstalled the Waze app or stopped using the app. 
It will analyze user data and develop a machine learning model that predicts user churn. 

This project is part of a larger effort at Waze to increase growth. Typically, high retention rates indicate satisfied users who repeatedly use the Waze app over time. 
Developing a churn prediction model will help prevent churn, improve user retention, and grow Waze’s business. 
An accurate model can also help identify specific factors that contribute to churn and answer questions such as: 

-Who are the users most likely to churn?

-Why do users churn? 

-When do users churn?
